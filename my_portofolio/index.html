                <div class="my-text"><p>Hi, I am Relga-Zidrey Nkounkou. You can call me Zidrey. I am from the Republic of the Congo, in central Africa. I am single and do not have children. I love watching English movies and listening to English podcasts, they help me to improve my English level. I used to practice Aikido, but for some reasons, I have stopped for a certain moment. I also learn to play piano.</p>
                
                <p>I know that God and His son Jesus Christ love us. I am member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the restored Church of the Living Christ. I have got the testimony that I am in the true restored church of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, the only one, that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the restored church. God is our Father, we lived with Him in the premortal life, loved Him and worshipped Him. He knows us and hears us, every time and everywhere. He as a plan for us, the plan of happiness. God wants us to become like Him. As He loves us so much, He sent His Begotten Son to save us from the evil. Jesus Christ endured our pains. If we have faith in Jesus Christ, repent and humble ourselves before Him, there is hope to go back beside of our Father in the last days. I am happy to be member of the restored church. God, Said in Amos 3 that He givest His secrets to His servants, the prophets. We have the privilege to have the living prophet viewer and revelator, Russel M. Nelson in the Church. He receives instructions from God to guide His people in these last days. If we follow him, there is hope to live in the God's presence in the eternal life.</p></div>
