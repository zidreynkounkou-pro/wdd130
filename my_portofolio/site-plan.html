        I know that God and His son Jesus Christ love us. I am member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the restored Church of the Living Christ. I have got the testimony that I am in the true restored church of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, the only one, that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the restored church. God is our Father, we lived with Him in the premortal life, loved Him and worshipped Him. He knows us and hears us, every time and everywhere. He as a plan for us, the plan of happiness. God wants us to become like Him. As He loves us so much, He sent His Begotten Son to save us from the evil. Jesus Christ endured our pains. If we have faith in Jesus Christ, repent and humble ourselves before Him, there is hope to go back beside of our Father in the last days. I am happy to be member of the restored church. God, Said in Amos 3 that He givest His secrets to His servants, the prophets. We have the privilege to have the living prophet viewer and revelator, Russel M. Nelson in the Church. He receives instructions from God to guide His people in these last days. If we follow him, there is hope to live in the God's presence in the eternal life.

      <h3>Career</h3>
      <p>
        I learned the electricity when I was in high school, it is one of my favorite Jobs I like doing. I got a Baccalaureat in Electrical Engineering. So, I deal with both, building and industrial electricities. I also, some knowledge in Mechanic that learned from my the small brother of my dad. I installed and powered some buildings here in my country. I do not have almost some experiences yet, but I do want to earn some.
      </p>
      <p> For some reasons, I went to economics faculty to study economics here in my country after I graduated from high school, but it did not take a long time until I found an opportunity to study the English language, I applied for Pathwayconnect programm from BYU-Pathway Worldwide. Computing has been always inspiring me, and after my completion of Pathwayconnect program, I was able to study the Computing, especially the Software Development so, I enrolled from BUY-Idaho to get a Bachelor's Degree in Softeware Development in the nearest future.

      <h3>Religion</h3>
      <p>
        As I said so far, I am a christian, member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I belive in Jesus Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer. I borned in the family where everyone is a protestant church member, so when I borned, my parents showed me the protestant church. I grew up with the saying in mind that I would never change the church one day until I leave this earth. It was one of the true churches in the world I thought. A few years after, at different time, two different people asked the same question, they asked me in what church I belonged. I said, I was a protestant and I would never change. They replied to me that I would change the church one day where I would serve my Lord, and grow spiritually. I had some doubt about it, because, I did not know where to go if I had to leave the protestant church. One year after, I hear about the Campus of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints. I started going there to learn English, then as they teach many other courses, in my case, the Religion Institute courses. I was touched about the messages I received there. I met the missionaries of the Church, some months after. Then, I decided to get baptized.

        One thing I loved when I first participated to the second meeting of the day, was the teaching about the family. I was amazed hearing about the family that day, the lesson was deep actually. I want to be a good father, and lesson was teaching about being good parents in your family. That the father has for responsability to provide some home for his family, he is the patriarch of the family, and, he needs to love his wife as he loves himself. The wife has to take care of the children, educcate them and also love her husband as she loves herself. Both the husband and wife have to be the good examples of the family, so the children will follow their patterns. They taught so much about the family, and I loved that. I have learned so much in the church that learned so where else. I found the truth, and it can only be one truth. The truth is the church of Jesus Christ is the restored church of the living Christ. Joseth Smith is really the prophet of the restoration. No one can change my mind about this truth.
