                    As I said so far, I am a christian, member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I belive in Jesus Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer. I borned in the family where everyone is a protestant church member, so when I borned, my parents showed me the protestant church. I grew up with the saying in mind that I would never change the church one day until I leave this earth. It was one of the true churches in the world I thought. A few years after, at different time, two different people asked the same question, they asked me in what church I belonged. I said, I was a protestant and I would never change. They replied to me that I would change the church one day where I would serve my Lord, and grow spiritually. I had some doubt about it, because, I did not know where to go if I had to leave the protestant church. One year after, I hear about the Campus of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints. I started going there to learn English, then as they teach many other courses, in my case, the Religion Institute courses. I was touched about the messages I received there. I met the missionaries of the Church, some months after. Then, I decided to get baptized.

                    One thing I loved when I first participated to the second meeting of the day, was the teaching about the family. I was amazed hearing about the family that day, the lesson was deep actually. I want to be a good father, and lesson was teaching about being good parents in your family. That the father has for responsability to provide some home for his family, he is the patriarch of the family, and, he needs to love his wife as he loves himself. The wife has to take care of the children, educcate them and also love her husband as she loves herself. Both the husband and wife have to be the good examples of the family, so the children will follow their patterns. They taught so much about the family, and I loved that. I have learned so much in the church that I had not learned yet some where else. I found the truth, and it can only be one truth. The truth is the church of Jesus Christ is the restored church of the living Christ. Joseth Smith is really the prophet of the restoration. No one can change my mind about this truth.
